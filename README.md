1. **Total Revenue by Flight ID** – Helps track revenue performance per flight.
2. **Total Bookings by Flight ID** – Displays booking volumes by flight.
3. **Average Delay & Average Rating by Airline** – Compares airline performance based on delay and customer satisfaction.
4. **Flight Delay Count by Airline** – Visualizes the frequency of delays by carrier.
5. **Maintenance Costs by Aircraft Type** – Highlights cost-intensive aircrafts.
6. **Average Delay by Year** – Identifies year-over-year delay trends.
7. **Maintenance Costs, Total Revenue, and Flights by Airline** – A multi-metric comparison.
8. **Flight Count by Aircraft Type** – Shows how frequently aircraft types are deployed.
9. **Aircraft Type vs. Route Count per Destination** – Displays aircraft deployment across destinations.
10. **Average Rating by Aircraft Type** – Links customer satisfaction to aircraft usage.
11. **Total Costs by Aircraft Type** – Combines fuel, crew, and maintenance expenses to show costliest aircrafts.
12. **Average Flight Duration vs. Maintenance Cost vs. Revenue** – A comparative chart analyzing cost and time trade-offs.
